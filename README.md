## Development note: Podcast player

We are using our own fork of [podigee/podigee-podcast-player](https://github.com/podigee/podigee-podcast-player) which can be found at [EngineeringKiosk/podigee-podcast-player](https://github.com/EngineeringKiosk/podigee-podcast-player).
The main differences of the fork in comparision to its origin can be found in the forks README.

In combination, we downloaded a minified version of [https://github.com/embedly/player.js](https://github.com/embedly/player.js) into `public/js`.
If we aim to upgrade *player.js*, download and replace the minified javascript file.
