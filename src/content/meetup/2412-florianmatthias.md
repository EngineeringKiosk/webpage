    title: 'A brief intro to Firmware-Over-the-Air Updates from an embedded device perspective'
    description: 'For embedded systems, robust firmware over-the-air (OTA) updates are essential. They ensure data protection, update integrity, and fast recovery from failures or attacks. As connected devices grow, fail-safe OTA updates are increasingly critical to prevent unauthorized access and system disruptions. Thomas will give a brief overview of the basic principles and some of the challenges.'

    title: 'Geeks, Dreamers, and Decency: Building Better Relationships in Tech'
    description: 'et’s face it getting technical and non-technical people to work seamlessly together can feel like herding cats, but it doesn’t have to be that way. Drawing from years of navigating the chaotic but rewarding world of product management (and yes, babysitting engineers), this talk dives into the art of bridging the gap between “geeks” and “non-geeks” in tech. We’ll explore real-world strategies for fostering better collaboration, sprinkled with humor, a dash of personal experience, and one guiding principle: being decent human beings goes a long way. Whether you’re the tech wizard or the big-picture dreamer, you’ll walk away with practical tips and maybe even a few laughs. Let’s turn the “us vs. them” dynamic into a team win. Ready to dive in? Let’s do this!'
    bio: 'I didn’t plan to become a product manager. If you’d told me about product management five years ago, I probably would’ve smiled and nodded like I knew what it was, only to Google it later. But somehow, this role found me while I was working as a UI designer for a startup. Fast forward to today, I’ve worked as a product manager at companies of all stages. And no, I’m not a project manager please stop asking. My days are a mix of babysitting software engineers, being the voice of reason to leadership teams, and occasionally pretending I have all the answers. When I’m not doing that, you’ll find me escaping reality through cooking, anime, and video games. I’m currently pursuing my master’s degree at the University of Innsbruck, diving deeper into all things tech and strategy. Today, I want to share some hard-earned lessons on building better relationships between technical and non-technical people lessons that start with one simple thing: being decent to each other. '
