    title: 'HPC vs Cloud Mindset'
    description: "While you would think that High Performance Computing and Cloud Computing communities should understand each other well, they can often not find common ground, with both sides remarking the others don't understand, are stubborn, or don't see the bigger picture. From the outside this is hard to understand. After all, they pretty much run (for outsiders) indistinguishable data centers and their platforms promise great benefits as soon as you get a hand of things. In this talk we will try to highlight that talking to each other is more that „merely getting the word meanings right“."
    bio: 'Peter did his PhD in Numerical Linear Algebra and started to use High Performance Computing (HPC) early in his studies. Later in his career he co-lead a project between 8 Universities that aimed to foster cooperation of Austrian Universities on HPC and Cloud Applications with a focus on usability and reduction of the „learning curve“. This is where he gained first hand experience on the topic at hand.'

    title: 'Who to trust'
    description: 'In this talk we examine our trust relationship in security protocols. We take TLS and SAML as examples and examine whether our trust is justified or if we should exercise more vigilance and caution when using and implementing security protocols. The answer is Jesus (and sometimes Bruce Schneier).'
    bio: "By day, Felix is a seasoned security consultant at Cancom and a network engineer with over 15 years of experience in keeping the digital world safe from threats. By night (and on weekends), he's a freelance mountain guide, scaling peaks when he's not scaling firewalls. Felix’s journey began in the idyllic classrooms of Bozen as an Admin and has since taken him to global networks with ILF Consulting Engineers, all while maintaining an academic footprint at universities in Innsbruck and Paderborn, where he earned his PhD in Network Security. Whether he's hunting down security vulnerabilities or guiding a group up a mountain, Felix always finds himself on top of things – metaphorically and literally!"
