    title: 'HPC vs Cloud Mindset'
    description: "While you would think that High Performance Computing and Cloud Computing communities should understand each other well, they can often not find common ground, with both sides remarking the others don't understand, are stubborn, or don't see the bigger picture. From the outside this is hard to understand. After all, they pretty much run (for outsiders) indistinguishable data centers and their platforms promise great benefits as soon as you get a hand of things. In this talk we will try to highlight that talking to each other is more that „merely getting the word meanings right“."
    bio: 'Peter did his PhD in Numerical Linear Algebra and started to use High Performance Computing (HPC) early in his studies. Later in his career he co-lead a project between 8 Universities that aimed to foster cooperation of Austrian Universities on HPC and Cloud Applications with a focus on usability and reduction of the „learning curve“. This is where he gained first hand experience on the topic at hand.'
