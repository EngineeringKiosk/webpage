    description: 'In this talk, I’ll share our team’s experience in developing design systems. After a brief overview of what a design system is and its benefits, we’ll explore the key aspects we’ve learned about creating components and how to organize them. I’ll discuss the tools and libraries that have proven useful, along with the lessons learned and challenges we’ve faced along the way. As our journey continues, I’ll highlight the areas where we aim to improve and evolve further.'
