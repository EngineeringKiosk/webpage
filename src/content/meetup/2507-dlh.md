    name: 'Julia Freund'
    title: 'Principles and Applications of Quantum Information Processing'
    description: "The classical computer has drastically changed our everyday personal and professional lives by utilising only the consequences of collective quantum mechanical properties (from an eagle's perspective). The concept of quantum computation and communication, on the other hand, is based on the properties of quantum particles for direct information processing. In this talk, we delve into foundational principles of quantum particles, superposition and entanglement, which redefine classical notions of computation and information. After understanding the key properties of quantum particles, we look at promising algorithms and communication protocols."
    bio: 'Julia is a theoretical physicist specializing in quantum networks and quantum communication. Her research focuses on the development of quantum network protocols tailored to the unique features and challenges, particularly noise and interaction with the environment, arising from quantum states. Apart from physics, she has a keen interest in classical information technology since her youth.'

    title: 'Talk Nerdy to Me: Mapping Mornings and Asking the Right Questions'
    description: "Let's face it - requirements engineering is often as clear as a Monday morning without coffee. But what if we told you that mapping your morning routine could hold the key to unlocking better communication and collaboration? In this talk, we’ll turn cereal spills and snooze alarms into a Story Mapping extravaganza, explore awesome ways to see from your stakeholders' perspectives and share the secret sauce of asking the right questions like a pro. Whether you’re here for the methods or just the live demo drama (spoiler: questions will be asked, minds will be blown), this is your chance to level up your requirements engineering & communication game without falling asleep."
    bio: "Annika is an IT project manager passionate about empowering individuals and teams to achieve their best. She combines customer-centric thinking, clear communication, and curiosity to deliver impactful solutions whilst being a team player. Annika draws energy from outdoor sports, especially climbing and dedicates time to supporting migrants learning German, fostering connection and growth both professionally and personally.
    Verena is a sports enthusiast – where team spirit, endurance, and quick decision-making are part of everyday life. That same energy fuels her work in IT project management. With a background in Economy, Data Science and the training to be a psychosocial counselor (under supervision), she also learned that sometimes the toughest bugs aren’t in the code, but in communication.
She moves between tech and business like a translator, bridge-builder – or, let’s be honest – a kindergarten teacher with a Gantt-chart. Great projects don’t just need structure and data, but also empathy, clarity, and the ability to laugh in the face of chaos (preferably with good coffee in hand)."
