    title: 'How an open source first strategy helps you to replace your engine at full speed!'
    description: 'For many, moving from proprietary software to open source feels like being thrown at the deep end. In the talk we will demonstrate how we moved with our VoiP platform from proprietary Cisco components to an Asterisk and Kubernetes based solution. We will showcase an excerpt of the used technologies and highlight their advantages and disadvantages for our needs. We will wrap up the talk by pointing out how open source has also benefited our marketing efforts.'
