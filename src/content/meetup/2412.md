    title: 'A brief intro to Firmware-Over-the-Air Updates from an embedded device perspective'
    description: 'For embedded systems, robust firmware over-the-air (OTA) updates are essential. They ensure data protection, update integrity, and fast recovery from failures or attacks. As connected devices grow, fail-safe OTA updates are increasingly critical to prevent unauthorized access and system disruptions. Thomas will give a brief overview of the basic principles and some of the challenges.'
