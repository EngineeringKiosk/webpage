    title: 'Towards More Secure Code - Why Devs Should Make My Job Harder'
    description: 'With one security vulnerability chasing the next through tech news, we all know that security is an important part of software engineering. But how come I still see the same common, avoidable flaws in code audits? In this talk we’ll take a brief tour through some common vulnerabilities every developer should know about and discuss sustainable procedures to prevent them.'

    title: 'Beyond Code: Lessons Learned as a Developer turned Engineering Manager in a Startup Environment'
    description: "What could possibly go wrong if a startup scales from a handful of developers to a company with 30 people? All of a sudden I found myself in the position of handling 10 developers and had to care about more than just the next pull request. \n Together we will take a look into the past and I will present some of our biggest challenges and personal learnings from growing and organizing a bunch of motivated developers without knowing where the journey will end. While theory explains you the easy way, practice always looks different. \n And who the heck is responsible for buying coffee beans and milk??"
