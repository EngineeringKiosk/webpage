    title: 'Assumption is the mother of all fuck ups.'
    description: 'Want to make better products without guessing what users need? In this talk, I will show you how gathering real user feedback can seriously level up your development process. We‚Äôll chat about what ‚Äöresearch‚Äò means, why research matters, how you can easily start doing it yourself, and why usability testing my favorite method. Perfect for anyone who‚Äôs curious about making tech that‚Äôs actually user-friendly.'
    bio: 'Michaela is a UX Researcher and UX Concepter at a digital design agency, with over four years of experience. While she loves crafting UX concepts for web, app, and embedded interfaces in Figma, what really drives her is getting away from the desk and talking to real user.'

    title: 'LangChain & LangGraph in Action: Building Smarter Tools with LLMs'
    description: 'This talk is a fast-paced, practical dive into building with large language models ‚Äî not just talking to them, but actually developing with them. We‚Äôll explore how to use LangChain and LangGraph to build intelligent tools that do "stuff". You‚Äôll see: When to use LangChain vs LangGraph (and when to just write a for-loop). A live walkthrough of building a content-generation tool that works (maybe ü§û). A showcase of a test automation assistant that turns ‚Äúclick & scroll‚Äù into ‚Äúcode & execute‚Äù. If you‚Äôre thinking of putting an LLM in your stack ‚Äî this is your crash course. (Note: This abstract may have been partially AI-generated. Or not. Who can say anymore?)'
    bio: 'Nazmi make things you can click ‚Äî or have a conversation with. He has done 3 years of mobile development and spent some memorable time with machine learning and VR. And also played around with whatever looked interesting ‚Äî Ktor, Spring, PrimeFaces, Vue, Tailwind, WordPress, Astro, Eleventy, ROS, ... etc. In short: Nazmi is into building stuff ‚Äî sometimes serious, sometimes ridiculous, but always fun.'
