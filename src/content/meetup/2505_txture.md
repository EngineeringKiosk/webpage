    title: 'LangChain & LangGraph in Action: Building Smarter Tools with LLMs'
    description: 'This talk is a fast-paced, practical dive into building with large language models ‚Äî not just talking to them, but actually developing with them. We‚Äôll explore how to use LangChain and LangGraph to build intelligent tools that do "stuff". You‚Äôll see: When to use LangChain vs LangGraph (and when to just write a for-loop). A live walkthrough of building a content-generation tool that works (maybe ü§û). A showcase of a test automation assistant that turns ‚Äúclick & scroll‚Äù into ‚Äúcode & execute‚Äù. If you‚Äôre thinking of putting an LLM in your stack ‚Äî this is your crash course. (Note: This abstract may have been partially AI-generated. Or not. Who can say anymore?)'
    bio: "Nazmi make things you can click ‚Äî or have a conversation with. He has done 3 years of mobile development and spent some memorable time with machine learning and VR. And also played around with whatever looked interesting ‚Äî Ktor, Spring, PrimeFaces, Vue, Tailwind, WordPress, Astro, Eleventy, ROS, ... etc. In short: Nazmi is into building stuff ‚Äî sometimes serious, sometimes ridiculous, but always fun."
