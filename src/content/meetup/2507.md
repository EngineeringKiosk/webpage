    title: 'Principles and Applications of Quantum Information Processing'
    description: "The classical computer has drastically changed our everyday personal and professional lives by utilising only the consequences of collective quantum mechanical properties (from an eagle's perspective). The concept of quantum computation and communication, on the other hand, is based on the properties of quantum particles for direct information processing. In this talk, we delve into foundational principles of quantum particles, superposition and entanglement, which redefine classical notions of computation and information. After understanding the key properties of quantum particles, we look at promising algorithms and communication protocols."
