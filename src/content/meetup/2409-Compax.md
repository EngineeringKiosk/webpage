    title: 'Beyond the Hype: Building a Real-Life RAG ChatBot'
    description: "The excitement around Large Language Models (LLM) and Generative AI (GenAI) has finally reached businesses everywhere, all dealing with data in different formats and qualities. In this talk, I'll walk you through a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) ChatBot project using Azure Cloud infrastructure with Confluence and Jira as data sources. We'll cover the journey from initial idea to a working minimum viable product (MVP), sharing technical challenges architectural decisions, and lessons learned along the way. This talk will balance technical details with business requirements, providing a practical overview of what it takes to build a RAG ChatBot. Join me for some insights, real-world experiences, and a few laughs as we navigate the world of GenAI together."
