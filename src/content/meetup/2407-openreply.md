    title: 'Peer Programming to increase "Team Quality”'
    description: 'Most engineers are familiar with pair programming. Your team may already encourage it to foster learning or as an alternative to ensuring code quality via pull-request reviews. This talk will show you the impact that collaboratively creating code has on "team quality" rather than just "code quality" - creating opportunities to build trust, increase shared ownership, and define and better understand a shared vision. And if you weren’t convinced before, we’ll end with a few practical tips on getting started with pair and mob-programming.'
