    title: 'Why Graphic Design Isn’t Magic (Though Maybe It Is)'
    description: '“Die Romana zaubert uns da schon was.” (“Romana will conjure up something for us.”) This phrase always irks me. People outside the creative field often think graphic design and illustration are some form of magic. Well, it isn’t—not like in Harry Potter, where a wave of a wand (or stylus pen) and a few words create something from nothing. But what if we redefine magic? In this talk, I’ll explore how graphic design can indeed be magic, discussing the conditions that make it so and the processes involved'
    bio: 'From a young age, I was always drawing. This childhood passion led me to study Graphics and Communication Design at the HTL in Innsbruck. Frustrated by the subjective "I don’t like it" feedback in design, I dabbled in studying computer science while working in sports retail, driven by my love for the outdoors and aversion to endless screen time. Throughout this period, I freelanced on the side for friends and acquaintances. For the past seven years, I’ve been an all-around designer and illustrator in a corporate setting.'

    title: 'Do Not Trust Your Eyes: The Semantic Pitfalls of Modern Image Compression'
    description: 'Digital images are integral to society, shaping public opinion in media, providing evidence in science, and influencing decisions in police investigations and courtrooms. However, most of these images are not preserved in their original form but are compressed to save storage and enable efficient transmission. Modern learning-based compression algorithms use neural networks to achieve unprecedented compression rates while maintaining high perceptual quality. However, these algorithms may replace difficult-to-compress image data with synthetic approximations, potentially altering the image’s semantic meaning. Given the seemingly high quality, compressed images appear plausible, and people are tempted to trust them.'
    bio: 'Nora Hofer is a Ph.D. student at the Security and Privacy Lab at the University of Innsbruck. Her research focuses on understanding and mitigating semantic changes introduced by learning-based image compression algorithms. In this talk, she will briefly introduce neural image compression, show examples of semantic changes, and discuss recent work towards mitigation strategies.'
