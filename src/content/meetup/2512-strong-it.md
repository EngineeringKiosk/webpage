    title: 'Context & Attention in Practice: Engineering Adaptive Real-World Machine Intelligence'
    description: 'Modern AI excels in software-only settings, yet industrial systems still rely on brittle, task-specific automation. At Data Lab Hell, we explore how advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, sensor fusion, and non-destructive metrology can be combined to build laboratory and production environments that are context-aware rather than fixed-function.
    This talk presents a practical engineering stack: multi-modal sensor fusion for high-fidelity state estimation; digital twins and physics-informed simulation for rapid surrogate modeling; and human-in-the-loop supervision with MLOps workflows—continuous training, versioned deployment, and model monitoring—to keep learning systems stable in noisy, drifting environments.
    A key enabler is the growing ecosystem of open-source AI robotics, providing standardized interfaces, reproducible simulators, and community-driven control stacks that shorten the path from prototype to production-ready adaptive agents.
    Underlying all of this is the idea of context and attention as design primitives for dynamically weighting signals, allocating compute, and improving model interpretability. These principles offer a realistic engineering pathway for moving from rigid automation to adaptive, interpretable, and continuously improving real-world robotic systems—potentially setting the stage for a “ChatGPT moment” in industrial robotics.'
    bio: 'Daniel Hauser is the Chief Innovation Officer at Data Lab Hell, where he leads research and technology transfer at the interface of science and industry. Trained as an experimental physicist (PhD), his work ranges from manipulating cold molecules in fundamental research to laser-based 3D glass printing and large-scale digitalization projects in the financial sector. At DLH, he collaborates with an interdisciplinary team spanning software engineering, mathematics, physics, and computer science to turn ambitious ideas into scalable applications—from physical simulations and precision sensing to data science and self-learning systems. He also heads the DLH Innovation Lab, building bridges between academic research and industrial partners to accelerate data-driven innovation.'
