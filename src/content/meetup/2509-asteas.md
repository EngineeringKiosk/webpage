    title: 'Between Code, Concept, and Embodied Experience: When Media Art Becomes a Laboratory'
    description: 'What happens when interaction isn’t aimed at optimization or problem-solving – but at irritation, questioning, and experimentation? In this talk, we offer insights into our collaborative work at the intersection of media art, interaction design, and technology. As media artists and an engineer/UX designer, we work on collaborative projects where we transform bodies, space, and code into performative interfaces, endlessly working machines, and large-scale spatial installations. We demonstrate how speculative practices from the arts can inspire us to rethink alternative forms of technology use and interaction – beyond functional systems, KPIs, and clearly defined use cases.'
    bio: 'Alexandra Reichart and Matthias Krauß form an artist duo, combining their diverse expertise to craft innovative artworks that merge technology, craft-based skills and performance elements. Their collaborative practice transcends traditional artistic boundaries, creating immersive installations that invite viewers to rethink their perceptions of art, technology, and interaction. Their artistic focus is on Interactive Media Installations - utilizing their deep knowledge of computer graphics and new media, their installations create dynamic, immersive environments that actively engage audiences. The duo experiments with the interplay between materials like latex and advanced technologies, generating unique forms and textures that challenge traditional artistic mediums. Their work delves into themes of human interaction, metamorphosis, autonomy, and control, offering a rich, thought-provoking commentary on the complexities of the modern human experience.'
