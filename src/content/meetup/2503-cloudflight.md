    title: 'Zephyr RTOS - embedded software leaving the stone age'
    description: The Zephyr Project, an open-source real-time operating system backed by The Linux Foundation, has spent nearly a decade evolving into a stable, reliable technology. With its liberal Apache 2.0 license and community-driven development, Zephyr has gained traction among both individual developers and companies alike. But what truly sets it apart are the technical details. This talk will inevitably touch on the frustrations of dealing with vendor-specific IDEs, while providing a brief dive into key aspects like the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), Kconfig, and west. Ultimately, it will explore how Zephyr is helping embedded software finally break free from the stone age.
    bio: Roland Lezuo has studied technical computer science in Vienna where he focused on disturbingly deep details of Java Virtual Machines. Though his PhD thesis on compiler correctness is all about precision and formality, he prefers to keep life more relaxed. Outside of work, he's a busy dad of three, and has successfully founded an embedded software company, which he later merged with an electronics firm. Today, he's the CEO of SILA Embedded Solutions, leading the charge with a passion for innovation and a hands-on approach.

    title: 'The Makeup Robot and Beyond: Co-Designing Assistive Tech for Inclusion'
    description: People with disabilities often face discrimination and lack of access in all areas of society. While cheap and accessible assistive technologies can support participation and independence, awareness and acceptance of disability are inevitable for an inclusive society. Our initiative INNklusion strives to tackle these problems by bringing together people with disabilities, students, researchers, and associations. During different lecture formats at the university, students co-design assistive technologies with people with disabilities. You will learn about interesting projects such as a public transportation navigator and a make-up robot as well as lessons learnt after one year in practice and our vision for a more inclusive region.
    bio: Currently, Katharina is doing her PhD in wearable robotics at the University of Innsbruck. Since her Master's she is working on different assistive technologies, such as a hand exoskeleton for people with limited hand mobility. Together with her colleagues, she founded Innklusion because building technologies is cool, but contributing to a more inclusive and respectful society makes it even more exciting.
