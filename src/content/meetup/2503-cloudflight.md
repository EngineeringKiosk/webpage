    title: 'The Makeup Robot and Beyond: Co-Designing Assistive Tech for Inclusion'
    description: People with disabilities often face discrimination and lack of access in all areas of society. While cheap and accessible assistive technologies can support participation and independence, awareness and acceptance of disability are inevitable for an inclusive society. Our initiative INNklusion strives to tackle these problems by bringing together people with disabilities, students, researchers, and associations. During different lecture formats at the university, students co-design assistive technologies with people with disabilities. You will learn about interesting projects such as a public transportation navigator and a make-up robot as well as lessons learnt after one year in practice and our vision for a more inclusive region.
    bio: Currently, Katharina is doing her PhD in wearable robotics at the University of Innsbruck. Since her Master's she is working on different assistive technologies, such as a hand exoskeleton for people with limited hand mobility. Together with her colleagues, she founded Innklusion because building technologies is cool, but contributing to a more inclusive and respectful society makes it even more exciting.
