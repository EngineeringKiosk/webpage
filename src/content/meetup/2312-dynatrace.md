    title: 'Unleashing the Power of Graphs in Java Code Structure Analysis'
    description: 'This talk explores Java code structure analysis using Graphs. It provides an introduction to Graphs and underscores their significance in both Graph Analysis and the field of Graph Data Science. The journey begins with exploring queries to analyze code dependencies and progresses to the application of graph algorithms for tasks such as community detection, centrality, and similarity. Additionally, the talk provides an introduction to node embeddings for machine learning. By the end of this presentation, software professionals will be well-equipped to extract valuable insights from Java code bases effectively.'
    bio: 'With software engineering, I turned one of my hobbies into my profession. I started programming as a kid and am still as passionate about it as I was back then. My work life started at Allgemeines Rechenzentrum (ARZ) in Innsbruck where I worked for 22+ years on the core banking system for accounts. I started as a mainframe developer with COBOL and switched then to Java. Later, i was leading a small team with members in Vienna and Innsbruck. In Mai 2023 I joined Dynatrace where I’m now writing apps for the 3rd gen of the product mainly using TypeScript. I spend my free time with my wife and two kids, playing and making music and sometimes also contributing to open source projects or publishing my own ideas.'

    title: 'Avalanche Safety in the Cloud: Automating Avalanche Reports with Serverless and Speech Synthesis'
    description: 'If a process is repetitive or a routine does not become a natural habit, we should automate! This applies not only to software development, but also to offline routines, such as internalizing the latest avalanche report before heading out into the snowy mountains. Automate. In this session, Christoph will provide insights into the "Avalanche Report Synthesizer" application, which automates the daily creation of a podcast-like avalanche report to make the reports more naturally accessible and audible. He will dive into this event-driven, serverless application and uncover the tools and frameworks used, from Pulumi (IaC), TypeScript serverless best practices to Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML).'
    bio: 'Christoph works as a Strategic Cloud Engineer at Google and focuses on the modernization of containerized applications and the development of serverless applications. NodeJS and Typescript are his favorite tools to go fast. Prior to Google, he worked at AWS and MaibornWolff developing apps and services on various web, mobile and cloud platforms. Originally from Zirl, he enjoys being close to the ‘cloud’ during mountaineering as well.'
