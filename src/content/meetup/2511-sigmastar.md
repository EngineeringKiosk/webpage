    title: 'Trustworthy Agents'
    description: 'Isn`t the title "Trustworthy Agents" a paradox? I believe it is. While LLMs are fantastic for many tasks, we know they are unstable, vulnerable to prompt injection, and prone to hallucination. Pure agent implementations that simply put an LLM in a loop will likely not fix these fundamental problems and limitations. At Otera, we have done research on how to build agents we can actually trust. Instead of blindly looping an LLM, we combine it with a fairly old and well-established technology: many-sorted first-order logic and automatic theorem proving. This approach provides a symbolic foundation that allows us to build a system whose behavior we can formally verify and trust. In this talk, I will argue that we should not blindly follow the agent hype. At the same time, I will show that LLMs are indeed powerful language models and that, when properly combined with symbolic systems, they can form the basis of trustworthy AI.'
    bio: 'David did his PhD in Machine Learning at the University of Innsbruck and has worked for over 15 years as a software developer and machine learning researcher at different companies. For the last 5 years, David has worked as a researcher at Otera, where he evaluated and implemented neural-symbolic systems. David did not use ChatGPT to write this … ok but I admit Gemini made some corrections :)'
