    title: 'Trustworthy Agents'
    description: 'Isn`t the title "Trustworthy Agents" a paradox? I believe it is. While LLMs are fantastic for many tasks, we know they are unstable, vulnerable to prompt injection, and prone to hallucination. Pure agent implementations that simply put an LLM in a loop will likely not fix these fundamental problems and limitations. At Otera, we have done research on how to build agents we can actually trust. Instead of blindly looping an LLM, we combine it with a fairly old and well-established technology: many-sorted first-order logic and automatic theorem proving. This approach provides a symbolic foundation that allows us to build a system whose behavior we can formally verify and trust. In this talk, I will argue that we should not blindly follow the agent hype. At the same time, I will show that LLMs are indeed powerful language models and that, when properly combined with symbolic systems, they can form the basis of trustworthy AI.'
    bio: 'David did his PhD in Machine Learning at the University of Innsbruck and has worked for over 15 years as a software developer and machine learning researcher at different companies. For the last 5 years, David has worked as a researcher at Otera, where he evaluated and implemented neural-symbolic systems. David did not use ChatGPT to write this … ok but I admit Gemini made some corrections :)'

    title: 'Frequency monitoring using AI'
    description: 'In 2014, the Tyrolean Government launched the campaign “Bergwelt Tirol – Miteinander erleben” to reduce conflicts between the many users of Tyrol’s alpine landscape. Limited space in the Alps often leads to overlapping activities — for example, downhill bikers and hikers sharing trails, hikers disturbing wildlife, or ski tourers crossing ski slopes and causing accidents. To prevent such incidents, guidance systems were introduced to define safe and optimal ascent routes for ski tourers. However, to assess their acceptance and usage, accurate data on ski tourer frequency is needed. Manual counting has proven inconsistent and insufficient, making reliable conclusions difficult. In this talk, I will present how we developed a low-cost, AI-based monitoring system that automatically detects and counts ski tourers using neural network technology. The system is highly accurate, privacy-compliant, and easy to maintain, providing continuous data for better decision-making. I will also showcase several practical applications of this system implemented over the past four years.'
    bio: 'Georg has been working for the Tyrolean Government since 2013 as an IT all-rounder in the field of air quality monitoring. He did hist MSc in Mechatronics and Smart Technologies at the Management Center Innsbruck. He is responsible for the entire IT infrastructure of Tyrol’s air quality monitoring service and develops a wide range of software solutions — from hardware-level drivers to full-stack web applications. In addition to software development, Georg designs custom electronics and PCB layouts for air quality monitoring devices and high-definition camera systems.'
