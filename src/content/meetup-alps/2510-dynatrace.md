    title: 'Inside Design Systems: From Vision to Implementation'
    description: 'In this talk, I’ll share our team’s experience in developing design systems. After a brief overview of what a design system is and its benefits, we’ll explore the key aspects we’ve learned about creating components and how to organize them. I’ll discuss the tools and libraries that have proven useful, along with the lessons learned and challenges we’ve faced along the way. As our journey continues, I’ll highlight the areas where we aim to improve and evolve further.'
    bio: 'Lukas is a frontend developer at AboutBits in South Tyrol, Italy. Specializing in React applications and design systems, he builds fast, efficient interfaces while keeping accessibility and user experience at the heart of his work. Lukas began experimenting with the web in the early era of HTML 4 and web scripting, later diving into PHP, Macromedia Flash, jQuery, Angular, and Vue — experience that now fuels his love for crafting modern, scalable interfaces.'

    title: 'How Ethernet Is Shaping the Future of Real-Time Applications — and What We’ve Learned in Professional Audio'
    description: 'Ethernet has become the backbone of modern connectivity — but adapting it to real-time applications requires more than just speed. Synchronization, determinism, and reliability are essential when every millisecond counts. In this talk, we’ll explore how Ethernet is evolving to meet the challenges of real-time networking. Drawing on lessons from professional audio — a field where sub-millisecond latencies and flawless synchronization are non-negotiable — we’ll discuss what it takes to engineer predictable performance on constrained systems. Key takeaways include: - How Ethernet standards like AVB/TSN enable deterministic networking. - Why professional audio serves as a demanding testbed for real-time technologies. - What these lessons mean for broader domains such as industrial, embedded, and IoT systems. Whether you work with sound, sensors, or synchronized systems, this talk will highlight how real-time Ethernet is shaping the future — and what we can learn from audio along the way.'
    bio: 'Fabian is the founder and CEO of JOYNED, a company dedicated to building embedded network software for professional audio and real-time applications. With a background spanning embedded systems, networking, and pro audio engineering, he has been deeply involved in the development and standardization of AVB/TSN and Milan, technologies that are shaping the future of deterministic networking. Through JOYNED, Fabian works closely with manufacturers worldwide to make complex networking technologies accessible and reliable, helping create the next generation of audio and embedded devices. His passion lies in bridging the gap between cutting-edge standards and practical, real-world implementations — with a special dedication to audio applications.'
