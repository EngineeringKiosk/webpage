    title: 'Why the Elves stayed in Middle Earth - How to manage a growing business without losing your developers.'
    description: 'Contrary to Steve Blank''s Article <a href="https://steveblank.com/2009/12/21/the-elves-leave-middle-earth-%E2%80%93-soda%E2%80%99s-are-no-longer-free/">The Elves Leave Middle Earth – Sodas Are No Longer Free</a>, Nextcloud has kept, and kept happy, their engineers through a period of significant growth and change. I will speak from my personal experience as an Engineer and employee as to the "why" of deciding to stay through a period of choppy waters - and how Nextcloud made it an easy decision every time.'

    title: 'Fast, independent and...useless? Building stuff people actually wanna use.'
    description: 'AI allows us to build faster, more independently, and with fewer constraints than ever before. But speed alone doesn’t create value. In this talk, I question a common assumption in tech: just because we can build something at lightning speed, does that mean we should? Drawing on my work at studio craft design, I explore how engineers and designers can combine technical power with human judgment — so we don’t just ship quickly, but build things that are truly useful, responsible, and worth people’s time.'
    bio: 'I work with B2B companies as a UX designer and strategist, translating between management, users, and technical teams. My focus is on turning complex products and websites into clear, effective user experiences through solid UX thinking and high-quality design mockups.'
